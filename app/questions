1) Explain REST and RESTful
REST means Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for systems on the web.
RESTful systems are characterized by their statelessness and the separation of client/server.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
A web API is an interface which exposes different endpoints, making a request–response message system, formatted in JSON or XML.

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
GET: retrieve resource
PUT: update resource
POST: create resource
DELETE: remove resource

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
In a stateless protocol, the server doesn't save any information about the client's previous message.
A Stateful protocol remembers specific details of a client.
HTTP is a stateless protocol.

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
A GET method is used to retrieve resources (and can't modify) and the parameters is sent in the url (query params)
A POST method is used to create a new resource and the parameters are stored in the request body.

6) You can’t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
I will try to narrow down the problem step by step and look for a solution in the internal documentation on the internet.
I will not hesitate to seek help or advice from my teammates if I can't find the solution myself.
I will also create an internal documentation to describe the problem and solution afterwards.
